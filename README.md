# yaasl - yet another atomic store library

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/PrettyCoffee/yaasl)](./LICENSE)

This project is meant for personal use only.
I won't stop you from using it, but I would rather recommend to use a similar
and more solid solution like `jotai` or `recoil`.

I just created yaasl for fun and to try things out.
